# About Me

<img src="https://kevin-shao-ustc.github.io/syy.jpg" class="floatpic" width="727" height="805">

Here is **Yiyang Shao (Kevin, 邵宜阳)**.

I am a junior undergraduate student and have a keen interest in robotics.

I am currently participating in the [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) competition, where I am responsible for developing navigation and control algorithms for different robots, which has given me a strong understanding of control theory, path planning algorithms, and mastery of techniques like SLAM and ROS.

Currently, I am developing navigation and nonlinear control algorithms based on NMPC and RL for a bipedal robot to enable robust autonomous navigation on uneven terrain.
