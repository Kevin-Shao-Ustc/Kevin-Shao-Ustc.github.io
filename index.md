# Yiyang Shao

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I am a junior undergraduate student in [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) and am keenly interested in robotics.

I am currently participating in the [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) competition, where I am responsible for developing navigation and control algorithms for different robots, which has given me a strong understanding of control theory, SLAM, and path-planning algorithms.

Currently, I am developing navigation and nonlinear control algorithms based on NMPC and RL for a bipedal robot to enable terrain-aware navigation in an uneven environment, as instructed by [Prof. Shiwu Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~swzhang/).

For more information, please refer to my latest [CV](https://kevin-shao-ustc.github.io/file/ENG_CV.pdf).

- **SLAM and navigation of a sentry robot**
  
   Developed a navigation system for a mobile robot, enhancing localization frequency and accuracy by integrating lidar, IMU, and encoder data with a Karman filter, and enabling the robot to navigate autonomously in uneven environments.

- **3D Pointcloud-Based Ground Robot 6-DoF Path Planning and Motion Control**  
  
  Aiming to develop a bipedal robot with lidar that can autonomously navigate through uneven terrain. Developing terrain analysis for bipedal robots currently.


- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Imitating Cat Righting Reflex**
  
  Developed control algorithms imitating the cat's righting reflex based on the TD3 algorithm.
