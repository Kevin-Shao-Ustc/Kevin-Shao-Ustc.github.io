# Yiyang Shao

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I am a junior undergraduate student in [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) and am keenly interested in robotics.

I am currently participating in the [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) competition, where I am responsible for developing navigation and control algorithms for different robots, which has given me a strong understanding of control theory, SLAM, and path-planning algorithms.

I am a self-motivated and independent learner. My previous experiences cultivated my strong ability to retrieve information and develop new skills independently. I also have a good foundation and intuition in math and physics.

Currently, I am developing navigation and nonlinear control algorithms based on NMPC and RL for a bipedal robot to enable terrain-aware navigation in an uneven environment, as instructed by [Prof. Shiwu Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~swzhang/).

## Research Experience

- **State Estimation and Control of a Bipedal Robot**
  I proposed a novel slip detection and state estimation strategy, which significantly improved the robot's robustness. The results will be published in a paper.

- **SLAM and navigation of a sentry robot**
   I developed a navigation system for a mobile robot, which has the preliminary ability to navigate autonomously in uneven environments. Still under development.

- **3D Pointcloud-Based Ground Robot 6-DoF Path Planning and Motion Control**  
  We aim to enable bipedal robots to autonomously navigate through uneven terrain. Still under development.

- **MOBA game AI based on Deep Reinforcement learning**
  
  We trained a game AI for the MOBA game _King Glory_ based on PPO and won first place

- **Neurodynamic Simulation of Demyelinating Neurological Damage Caused by SARS-COV-2**
  We investigated how SARS-COV-2 damages human brain function by neurodynamic simulation.

- **Replication: 3D Photography on Your Desk**
  I replicated the classical computer vision paper _3D Photography on Your Desk_

- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Imitating Cat Righting Reflex**
  I led a team to develop control algorithms imitating the cat's righting reflex based on the TD3 algorithm.
